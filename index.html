        <div class="history">
            <h6>Our pub has a long and colourful history, and if you're interested, we'd love to share it with you.</h6>
            <p>
                While the pub is currently owned and managed by the Reynolds family, it has changed hands many times through the years, and served many purposes.</br>
                </br>
                Originally built as a halfway-house between Bristol and London in the mid-16th century, the building was a single storey, with only three rooms - A room for the owner and his wife, a common area, and a room for the merchants and travellers who stayed
                the night to sleep in.
                </br>
                </br>
                It remained a halfway-house until 1896, when the UK Locomotive Act was repealed and motor vehicles travelling by road no longer needed a man waving a red flag and blowing a horn to walk ahead of them. This allowed cars to become more widespread, changing
                the journey from London to Bristol from a several day excursion to a trip manageable in a single day.</br>
                </br>This change meant that a halfway-house was no longer necessary, and thus the property was sold to become a family home. It was during this time that the building recieved several of its many expansions, upgrading it from three rooms to
                five.
                </br>
                </br>This change did not last, however, as the start of World War One in 1914 saw the new family's father and only son enlist in the army, leaving their mother alone. Unfortunately, neither of them made it home from the war, and their mother
                moved out of the house in 1920.</br>
                </br>
                The property remained uninhabited for 12 years, until 1932, when it was finally bought by the current owners' great grandfather, Frank Reynolds, fixed up, expanded to a two storey building and converted into a pub, which it has of course remained, under
                the same family's care ever since.
